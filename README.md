### Task : 

Let say we have a covid vaccination report of a state.
Vaccination percentage is  
Jan : 10.5%,  Feb : 12%,  Mar : 14.5% ..... Dec : 82%

Write a python program that gives the percentage of vaccinated people when we give a month number as input. Consider month number 1 for Jan,  2 for Feb and so on 12 for Dec.

Ex :  When we give input as 3, then the output should be 14.5
When we give input as 7, the output should be 34.5
Try to find the percentage with a logic when we pass month number.

Things to share with us :
1. Source code
2. Screenshots of output when we give inputs 3, 6 , 9, 11
